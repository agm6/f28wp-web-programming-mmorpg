# f28wp-web-programming-mmorpg
An MMO RPG game for F28WP Web Programming.

# Details
We will be developing an online multiplayer game that lets players interact with one another and compete in realtime. It will be able to store and display information (e.g., high-scores, number of online active players), play against other
people and allow you to join other player's games. The online interaction will be communicated to a web server and recorded in
server side storage (e.g. MongoDB, MySQL or files), as well as being displayed back to the user's client
(e.g., leaderboards, other player interaction). The front-end will also let a user list all or some of the
game information that is available (e.g., playerâ€™s past scores and other where they sit in the global
high scores).

The following Web technologies should be used
- HTML 5 (XHTML syntax), CSS 3, DOM 1+ and JavaScript
- Client and server side technologies and Database (or server storage system)


# Objectives
- Design and implementation of a web-based 'multiplayer' game
- Theory and practice of server-side scripting and database for web games
- Code modulation in JavaScript
- Techniques to implement best practices in web development such as Test-Driven -
Development, Version Control and JavaScript documentation API
- Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and testing

# Development Enviroment
Access to a web server for online publication, access to a software version control system (GIT),
access to a limited range of web services (e.g. a high-score service, game-state management
services)

# Goals

# Requirements
- Github
  + show contributions weekly (commits, tasks, bug fixes, etc)
  + insights:
    - contributors
    - commits
    - code frequency
    - dependacies
- avoid libraries
- use testing 
- complex implementation
- HTML5/CSS/Javascript complient
- Animated and dynamic
