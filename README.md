# f28wp-web-programming-mmorpg
An MMO RPG game for F28WP Web Programming.

# Details
A develop an online multiplayer game that that lets players interact and play other people in realtime. Store and view information (e.g., high-scores, number of online active players). Play other
people or join other games. On interaction should be communicated to a web server and recorded in
server side storage (e.g. MongoDB, MySQL or files), as well as being displayed back to the user side
(e.g., leaderboards, other player interaction). The front-end should also let a user list all or some
game information that is available (e.g., playerâ€™s past scores and other where they sit in the global
high scores).

The following Web technologies should be used
- HTML 5 (XHTML syntax), CSS 3, DOM 1+ and JavaScript
- Client and server side technologies and Database (or server storage system)


# Objectives
- Design and implementation web-based 'multiplayer' game
- Theory and practice of server-side scripting and database for web games
- Code modulation in JavaScript
- Techniques to implement best practices in web development such as Test-Driven -
Development, Version Control and JavaScript documentation API
- Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and testing

# Development Enviroment
Access to a web server for online publication, access to a software version control system (GIT),
access to a limited range of web services (e.g. a high-score service, game-state management
services)

# Goals

# Requirements
- Github
  + show contributions weekly (commits, tasks, bug fixes, etc)
  + insights:
    - contributors
    - commits
    - code frequency
    - dependacies
- avoid libraries
- use testing 
- complex implementation
- HTML5/CSS/Javascript complient
- Animated and dynamic
